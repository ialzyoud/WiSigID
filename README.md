# WiSigID
In this project, we examine identification of the wireless signals over the air. The project is based on K. Tekbiyik, Ö. Akbunar, A. R. Ekti, A. Görçin and G. Karabulut Kurt, "Multi–Dimensional Wireless Signal Identification Based on Support Vector Machines," in IEEE Access, vol. 7, pp. 138890-138903, 2019.
